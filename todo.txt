1. response llm tool call (product detail, etc.)

2. concurrent and recheck i/o bound
 Why AsyncIO is optimal for your chatbot:
  - I/O-Bound Architecture: 90% of processing time is waiting for LLM/Redis responses
  - Memory Efficiency: Single-threaded, no context switching overhead
  - Easy Migration: Minimal changes to existing code structure
  - Redis Compatibility: aioredis integrates seamlessly

  Implementation Roadmap

  Phase 1: Core Async Conversion (2-3 hours)
  1. Convert LLM calls to async (using aiohttp)
  2. Convert Redis operations to async (aioredis)
  3. Convert file I/O to async (aiofiles)

  Phase 2: Concurrent Processing (1-2 hours)
  1. Implement user session isolation
  2. Add connection pooling for Redis/HTTP
  3. Parallel NLU + Response generation

  Expected Performance Gains:
  - Single User: 20-30% faster (no blocking)
  - Multiple Users: 5-10x throughput increase
  - Memory Usage: Same or lower (no thread overhead)

  Quick Start Implementation

  Would you like me to implement the AsyncIO conversion for your chatbot? I can start with converting the core components to async/await pattern
  while maintaining your existing architecture.


‚è∫ Summary: AsyncIO is your best option - it provides significant performance improvements for I/O-bound operations like your LLM calls and Redis
  operations, with minimal architectural changes required. The implementation maintains your existing dual-memory system while enabling concurrent
  user processing.
